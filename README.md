# Pokemon_Projects

Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out my GitHub. Here you will find a collection of Pokemon projects that 
I am developing to practice and implement data science and data engineering skills.

Each project will contain it's own ReadMe markdown as well as other useful documentation.
